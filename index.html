    <p>Most people think that Denver is used to a lot of snow but on 02/02/2022 Denver received 13 inches of snow and the city was shut down. I didn't have to go to work because many offices closed. Since there weren't many cars on the road, people could get out in their snowmobiles. </p>

    <p>Children received a snow day because the schools shut down. So they made good use of their day by building snowmen.</p>
